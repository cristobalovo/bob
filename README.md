# BoB 
BoB is the browser of browsers, a URL-based content delivery and communications protocol with options to anonymously sell your manually curated psychographic data as a service. We just call it bob. . Download our desktop browser and go on the web like you normally would without any sort of complicated on-boarding. Use the web as a way to interface new services and data sets that are provided through decentralized technologies. Using 3Box you can hijack the web and add an additional content delivery system and communications layer out of the box. Our domain DAO allows a set of domain investors to approve or reject other Dapps or DAOs to be deployed to that domain. Our ad contract allows any user to bid to post an ad on the decentralized domain component in our browser. Using equity info from the domain DAO, domain investors can use equity based voting to decide whether or not to allow this ad to be hosted. If they vote yes, they are paid by the advertiser from an escrow contract. If they vote no, the bidder is refunded. This is just one example of a Dapp that could be integrated into a domain by the DAO.
